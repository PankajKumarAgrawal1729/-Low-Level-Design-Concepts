The **Observer Design Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object (the **subject**) changes its state, all its dependents (known as **observers**) are automatically notified and updated. It’s commonly used to implement distributed event-handling systems and the publish-subscribe model.

### Key Concepts

- **Subject**: The object being observed. It maintains a list of observers and notifies them of any changes in its state.
- **Observer**: The objects that want to be informed of changes in the subject's state. They register themselves with the subject.
- **ConcreteSubject**: The object whose state changes and which notifies all observers.
- **ConcreteObserver**: The objects that get notified when the subject's state changes.

### Example Scenario

Let’s say we are developing a simple weather monitoring system. When the weather changes (the **subject**), it notifies multiple display devices (the **observers**) to show the updated weather information.

### Implementation in Java

#### Step 1: Define the Observer Interface

```java
interface Observer {
    void update(float temperature, float humidity, float pressure);
}
```

- **Observer Interface**: Declares the `update` method that will be called by the subject to notify the observer about any changes in the weather data.

#### Step 2: Define the Subject Interface

```java
interface Subject {
    void registerObserver(Observer observer);
    void removeObserver(Observer observer);
    void notifyObservers();
}
```

- **Subject Interface**: Declares methods for registering, removing, and notifying observers.

#### Step 3: Create the Concrete Subject Class

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class WeatherData implements Subject {
    private List<Observer> observers;
    private float temperature;
    private float humidity;
    private float pressure;

    public WeatherData() {
        observers = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    @Override
    public void registerObserver(Observer observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }

    @Override
    public void removeObserver(Observer observer) {
        observers.remove(observer);
    }

    @Override
    public void notifyObservers() {
        for (Observer observer : observers) {
            observer.update(temperature, humidity, pressure);
        }
    }

    // Method to set new weather data and notify observers
    public void setMeasurements(float temperature, float humidity, float pressure) {
        this.temperature = temperature;
        this.humidity = humidity;
        this.pressure = pressure;
        notifyObservers();
    }
}
```

- **ConcreteSubject (`WeatherData`)**: Stores the state of the weather and notifies all observers when the weather data changes.

#### Step 4: Create Concrete Observer Classes

```java
class CurrentConditionsDisplay implements Observer {
    private float temperature;
    private float humidity;

    @Override
    public void update(float temperature, float humidity, float pressure) {
        this.temperature = temperature;
        this.humidity = humidity;
        display();
    }

    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Current conditions: " + temperature + "F degrees and " + humidity + "% humidity");
    }
}

class StatisticsDisplay implements Observer {
    private float maxTemp = 0.0f;
    private float minTemp = 200;
    private float tempSum = 0.0f;
    private int numReadings = 0;

    @Override
    public void update(float temperature, float humidity, float pressure) {
        tempSum += temperature;
        numReadings++;

        if (temperature > maxTemp) {
            maxTemp = temperature;
        }

        if (temperature < minTemp) {
            minTemp = temperature;
        }

        display();
    }

    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Avg/Max/Min temperature = " + (tempSum / numReadings) + "/" + maxTemp + "/" + minTemp);
    }
}
```

- **ConcreteObserver (`CurrentConditionsDisplay`)**: Displays the current temperature and humidity.
- **ConcreteObserver (`StatisticsDisplay`)**: Displays statistics like the average, maximum, and minimum temperature.

#### Step 5: Client Code to Test the Implementation

```java
public class WeatherStation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WeatherData weatherData = new WeatherData();

        CurrentConditionsDisplay currentDisplay = new CurrentConditionsDisplay();
        StatisticsDisplay statisticsDisplay = new StatisticsDisplay();

        weatherData.registerObserver(currentDisplay);
        weatherData.registerObserver(statisticsDisplay);

        weatherData.setMeasurements(80, 65, 30.4f);
        weatherData.setMeasurements(82, 70, 29.2f);
        weatherData.setMeasurements(78, 90, 29.2f);
    }
}
```

### Output

```
Current conditions: 80.0F degrees and 65.0% humidity
Avg/Max/Min temperature = 80.0/80.0/80.0
Current conditions: 82.0F degrees and 70.0% humidity
Avg/Max/Min temperature = 81.0/82.0/80.0
Current conditions: 78.0F degrees and 90.0% humidity
Avg/Max/Min temperature = 80.0/82.0/78.0
```

### Explanation

- **Observer (`Observer`)**: Defines an interface for objects that want to be notified about changes in the subject’s state.
- **Subject (`WeatherData`)**: Implements the `Subject` interface, manages observers, and notifies them when the weather data changes.
- **Concrete Observers (`CurrentConditionsDisplay`, `StatisticsDisplay`)**: Implement the `Observer` interface and display the weather data upon receiving updates from the subject.
- **Client (`WeatherStation`)**: Simulates the weather monitoring system by updating the weather data and notifying all observers.

### Benefits

- **Loose Coupling**: The subject and observers are loosely coupled. The subject doesn't need to know details about the observers, only that they implement the `Observer` interface.
- **Scalability**: New observers can be added without changing the subject’s code.
- **Automatic Notification**: Observers are automatically notified when the subject changes, which can be useful in real-time systems.

### Drawbacks

- **Performance Overhead**: If there are many observers or the update process is time-consuming, notifying all observers may cause a performance bottleneck.
- **Update Triggering**: Unnecessary updates can occur if observers don’t need all the changes made by the subject, leading to inefficiency.
  
### Use Cases

- **Event Handling Systems**: Commonly used in GUI frameworks where user actions like clicking a button trigger updates to multiple UI elements.
- **Data Binding**: In applications like MVC (Model-View-Controller), when the model changes, the view is automatically updated.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Monitoring systems that need to notify observers about changes in data, like weather stations, stock prices, etc.

### Real-World Example

- **Java `Observer` and `Observable`**: Java provides built-in support for the observer pattern via the `Observable` class and `Observer` interface (though deprecated in Java 9 and above in favor of event listeners or property change listeners).
  
The **Observer Design Pattern** allows for flexibility and modularity in the code by creating a one-to-many relationship between objects, where the subject automatically notifies observers when its state changes. This decoupling of objects enhances the maintainability and scalability of systems.
