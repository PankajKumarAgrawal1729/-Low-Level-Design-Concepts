The **Memento Design Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that provides the ability to restore an object to a previous state without exposing its internal structure. This pattern is often used in applications that require the ability to undo or rollback operations, where it's essential to save and restore the state of an object.

### Key Concepts

- **Originator**: The object whose state needs to be saved or restored. It creates the `Memento` and uses it to revert to a previous state.
- **Memento**: A value object that stores the state of the `Originator` and is accessible only to the originator.
- **Caretaker**: Manages the `Memento` and is responsible for storing and retrieving it. It doesn't modify or inspect the contents of the `Memento`.

### Example Scenario

Let's implement a simple text editor where we can type, save the state of the text, and undo it. The state of the editor is the content of the text. We'll use the Memento pattern to save and restore the state.

### Implementation in Java

#### Step 1: Define the Memento Class

```java
class TextEditorMemento {
    private final String textState;

    public TextEditorMemento(String state) {
        this.textState = state;
    }

    public String getState() {
        return textState;
    }
}
```

- **Memento**: This class stores the state (the text) of the text editor. It is immutable and only the `Originator` (text editor) can use it to restore the state.

#### Step 2: Create the Originator Class

```java
class TextEditor {
    private StringBuilder text = new StringBuilder();

    public void addText(String newText) {
        text.append(newText);
    }

    public String getText() {
        return text.toString();
    }

    public TextEditorMemento save() {
        return new TextEditorMemento(text.toString());
    }

    public void restore(TextEditorMemento memento) {
        this.text = new StringBuilder(memento.getState());
    }
}
```

- **Originator**: This class represents the text editor. It can add text, save the current state using the `save()` method, and restore the previous state using the `restore()` method.

#### Step 3: Create the Caretaker Class

```java
import java.util.Stack;

class Caretaker {
    private Stack<TextEditorMemento> history = new Stack<>();

    public void save(TextEditor editor) {
        history.push(editor.save());
    }

    public void undo(TextEditor editor) {
        if (!history.isEmpty()) {
            editor.restore(history.pop());
        } else {
            System.out.println("No states to undo!");
        }
    }
}
```

- **Caretaker**: This class manages the `Memento` objects. It keeps a history of `Memento` states and allows undoing changes by popping the most recent state and restoring it in the `Originator`.

#### Step 4: Create the Client

```java
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TextEditor editor = new TextEditor();
        Caretaker caretaker = new Caretaker();

        // Type some text and save the state
        editor.addText("Hello, ");
        caretaker.save(editor);

        // Add more text and save the state again
        editor.addText("world!");
        caretaker.save(editor);

        // Display current text
        System.out.println("Current Text: " + editor.getText());

        // Undo the last change
        caretaker.undo(editor);
        System.out.println("After Undo: " + editor.getText());

        // Undo the previous change
        caretaker.undo(editor);
        System.out.println("After Second Undo: " + editor.getText());
    }
}
```

### Output

```
Current Text: Hello, world!
After Undo: Hello, 
After Second Undo: 
```

### Explanation

- **Memento (`TextEditorMemento`)**: Holds the state of the `TextEditor`. In this case, it stores the text content.
- **Originator (`TextEditor`)**: The object whose state is being saved and restored. It can save its current state to a `Memento` and restore a previous state.
- **Caretaker (`Caretaker`)**: Manages the saving and undoing of states. It keeps track of the history of mementos and can revert the editor to a previous state.
- **Client**: Uses the `Caretaker` to save and restore the state of the `TextEditor` through mementos.

### Benefits

- **Encapsulation of State**: The internal state of the `Originator` is saved in a `Memento` without exposing the internal structure to the outside world.
- **Separation of Concerns**: The `Originator` handles its own state, while the `Caretaker` only manages the saving and restoration process without knowing about the actual state.
- **Undo Functionality**: The pattern provides a natural way to implement undo/redo functionality.

### Drawbacks

- **Memory Overhead**: If the state of the `Originator` is large or the history is long, storing multiple `Memento` objects can consume significant memory.
- **Complex State**: For complex objects with many interdependent properties, capturing and restoring state can become tricky.

### Use Cases

- **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Commonly used in applications like text editors, image editors, and IDEs to implement undo/redo features.
- **State Recovery**: Applications that require state rollback in case of failure or error conditions, like database systems or transactional systems.
- **Versioning Systems**: Used in systems where different versions of an object or document need to be saved and restored.

### Real-World Example

- **Text Editors**: In word processing applications like Microsoft Word or Google Docs, the ability to undo and redo changes is a typical use case for the Memento pattern. The text at various stages is saved, allowing the user to revert to a previous version.

The **Memento Design Pattern** allows you to save and restore an object's state without violating encapsulation, making it a powerful tool for implementing undo/redo functionality and state recovery in software systems.
