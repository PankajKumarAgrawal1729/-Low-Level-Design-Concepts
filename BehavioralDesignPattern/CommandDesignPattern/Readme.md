The **Command Design Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern in which objects are used to represent actions or operations. A `Command` object encapsulates all the information needed to perform an action, including the method to call, the parameters to pass, and the object that owns the method.

### Key Concepts

- **Command**: Declares an interface for executing an operation.
- **Concrete Command**: Implements the `Command` interface and defines a binding between a receiver object and an action.
- **Receiver**: The object that performs the actual action.
- **Invoker**: Asks the `Command` to carry out the request.
- **Client**: Creates the `ConcreteCommand` and associates it with the receiver.

### Example Scenario

Imagine a simple text editor with the ability to perform undo and redo operations. The commands like "Write Text," "Undo," and "Redo" can be encapsulated into separate objects, allowing the text editor to execute these operations without knowing the specifics of how they are implemented.

### Implementation in Java

#### Step 1: Define the Command Interface

```java
interface Command {
    void execute();
    void undo();
}
```

#### Step 2: Create the Receiver Class

```java
class TextEditor {
    private StringBuilder text = new StringBuilder();

    public void writeText(String newText) {
        text.append(newText);
    }

    public void deleteText(int length) {
        int start = text.length() - length;
        if (start >= 0) {
            text.delete(start, text.length());
        }
    }

    public String getText() {
        return text.toString();
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Create Concrete Command Classes

```java
class WriteCommand implements Command {
    private TextEditor editor;
    private String textToWrite;

    public WriteCommand(TextEditor editor, String textToWrite) {
        this.editor = editor;
        this.textToWrite = textToWrite;
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        editor.writeText(textToWrite);
    }

    @Override
    public void undo() {
        editor.deleteText(textToWrite.length());
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Create the Invoker Class

```java
import java.util.Stack;

class TextEditorInvoker {
    private Stack<Command> commandHistory = new Stack<>();

    public void executeCommand(Command command) {
        command.execute();
        commandHistory.push(command);
    }

    public void undo() {
        if (!commandHistory.isEmpty()) {
            Command command = commandHistory.pop();
            command.undo();
        }
    }
}
```

#### Step 5: Create the Client

```java
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TextEditor editor = new TextEditor();
        TextEditorInvoker invoker = new TextEditorInvoker();

        Command writeCommand1 = new WriteCommand(editor, "Hello ");
        Command writeCommand2 = new WriteCommand(editor, "World!");

        invoker.executeCommand(writeCommand1);
        invoker.executeCommand(writeCommand2);

        System.out.println("Text after write commands: " + editor.getText());

        invoker.undo();
        System.out.println("Text after undo: " + editor.getText());

        invoker.undo();
        System.out.println("Text after second undo: " + editor.getText());
    }
}
```

### Output

```
Text after write commands: Hello World!
Text after undo: Hello 
Text after second undo: 
```

### Explanation

- **Command Interface (`Command`)**: Declares two methods: `execute()` to perform the command and `undo()` to revert it.
- **Concrete Command (`WriteCommand`)**: Implements the `Command` interface. The `execute()` method writes text to the editor, and `undo()` removes it.
- **Receiver (`TextEditor`)**: Contains the actual logic for writing and deleting text.
- **Invoker (`TextEditorInvoker`)**: Holds a stack of commands and executes them. It also allows undoing the last executed command.
- **Client**: The client creates command objects, associates them with the receiver (the `TextEditor`), and uses the invoker to execute commands.

### Benefits

- **Encapsulation of Commands**: Each command is encapsulated in a class, allowing you to treat all commands uniformly.
- **Undo/Redo Functionality**: By storing commands in a history stack, you can easily implement undo/redo functionality.
- **Decoupling of Invoker and Receiver**: The invoker doesn't need to know about the receiver's internal workings; it simply calls the `execute()` and `undo()` methods of a command object.

### Drawbacks

- **Increased Number of Classes**: Each command requires a separate class, which can increase the complexity of the code.
- **Command History Maintenance**: If commands contain too much information, managing a history stack can become memory-intensive.

### Use Cases

- **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Commonly used in text editors, graphics editors, or any software where actions need to be undone or redone.
- **Transaction Management**: Used in transactional systems where each transaction is represented as a command that can be committed or rolled back.
- **Remote Controls**: In systems like home automation, commands like "turn on the light," "increase temperature," etc., can be encapsulated into command objects.

The **Command pattern** is a powerful tool for managing operations that need to be performed and reversed, especially when you need to decouple the object that issues a request from the one that performs it. It also provides an elegant way to implement features like undo/redo in applications.
