- SRP: A class should have only one responsibility.
- OCP: Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- LSP: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
- ISP: Clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they do not use.
- DIP: Depend on abstractions, not concretions.
