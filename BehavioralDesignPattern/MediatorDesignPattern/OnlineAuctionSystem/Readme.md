The **Mediator Design Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that promotes loose coupling between objects by ensuring that they communicate with each other through a central mediator object instead of directly. This pattern allows objects to interact without being aware of each other's presence, reducing dependencies and making the system easier to maintain and extend.

### Key Concepts

- **Mediator**: The central object that facilitates communication between other objects. It manages how and when they interact.
- **Colleague**: These are the individual objects that interact with each other, but their interaction is managed by the mediator. Each colleague knows the mediator but doesn't know about other colleagues.
- **ConcreteMediator**: Implements the communication logic between the colleagues.
- **ConcreteColleague**: Represents the components or objects that communicate via the mediator.

### Example Scenario

Let's consider a **chatroom application**, where multiple users (colleagues) communicate through a central chatroom (mediator). Instead of sending messages directly to each user, the users send messages to the chatroom, and the chatroom distributes the messages to the appropriate participants.

### Implementation in Java

#### Step 1: Define the Mediator Interface

```java
interface ChatMediator {
    void sendMessage(String message, User user);
    void addUser(User user);
}
```

- **Mediator Interface**: This defines the `sendMessage` method that allows users to send messages, and `addUser` to add new users to the chatroom.

#### Step 2: Define the ConcreteMediator Class

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class ChatRoom implements ChatMediator {
    private List<User> users;

    public ChatRoom() {
        this.users = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    @Override
    public void sendMessage(String message, User user) {
        for (User u : users) {
            // Message should not be received by the sender.
            if (u != user) {
                u.receive(message);
            }
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void addUser(User user) {
        users.add(user);
    }
}
```

- **ConcreteMediator (`ChatRoom`)**: Implements the `ChatMediator` interface and manages the communication between users. It keeps a list of users and broadcasts a message to all users except the one who sent it.

#### Step 3: Define the Colleague Class (User)

```java
abstract class User {
    protected ChatMediator mediator;
    protected String name;

    public User(ChatMediator mediator, String name) {
        this.mediator = mediator;
        this.name = name;
    }

    public abstract void send(String message);
    public abstract void receive(String message);
}
```

- **Colleague Class (`User`)**: This abstract class defines the basic structure for a user who can send and receive messages. The mediator facilitates communication between users.

#### Step 4: Define Concrete Colleague Classes

```java
class BasicUser extends User {
    public BasicUser(ChatMediator mediator, String name) {
        super(mediator, name);
    }

    @Override
    public void send(String message) {
        System.out.println(this.name + " sends: " + message);
        mediator.sendMessage(message, this);
    }

    @Override
    public void receive(String message) {
        System.out.println(this.name + " received: " + message);
    }
}

class PremiumUser extends User {
    public PremiumUser(ChatMediator mediator, String name) {
        super(mediator, name);
    }

    @Override
    public void send(String message) {
        System.out.println(this.name + " sends: " + message);
        mediator.sendMessage(message, this);
    }

    @Override
    public void receive(String message) {
        System.out.println(this.name + " received: " + message);
    }
}
```

- **ConcreteColleague (`BasicUser`, `PremiumUser`)**: These are two concrete user classes that can send and receive messages. The `send` method passes the message to the mediator, while the `receive` method simply displays the message.

#### Step 5: Client Code to Test the Mediator Pattern

```java
public class MediatorPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ChatMediator chatRoom = new ChatRoom();

        User user1 = new BasicUser(chatRoom, "Alice");
        User user2 = new PremiumUser(chatRoom, "Bob");
        User user3 = new BasicUser(chatRoom, "Charlie");
        User user4 = new PremiumUser(chatRoom, "Dave");

        chatRoom.addUser(user1);
        chatRoom.addUser(user2);
        chatRoom.addUser(user3);
        chatRoom.addUser(user4);

        user1.send("Hello everyone!");
        user2.send("Hi Alice!");
    }
}
```

### Output

```
Alice sends: Hello everyone!
Bob received: Hello everyone!
Charlie received: Hello everyone!
Dave received: Hello everyone!
Bob sends: Hi Alice!
Alice received: Hi Alice!
Charlie received: Hi Alice!
Dave received: Hi Alice!
```

### Explanation

- **Mediator (`ChatRoom`)**: Manages the communication between the users. When a user sends a message, the chatroom sends it to all other users.
- **Colleagues (`BasicUser`, `PremiumUser`)**: These users can send and receive messages. They interact with each other only via the mediator (chatroom).
- **Client (`MediatorPatternDemo`)**: This simulates the chatroom by creating users, registering them with the chatroom, and sending messages between them.

### Benefits

- **Loose Coupling**: The colleagues (users) are decoupled from each other. They don’t need to know anything about the other participants, only about the mediator.
- **Centralized Control**: The mediator encapsulates how the objects interact, allowing you to change how communication happens without affecting the colleagues.
- **Simplified Object Interaction**: Especially useful in scenarios where many objects need to interact, as it prevents a complex network of inter-object communication.

### Drawbacks

- **Mediator Complexity**: The mediator can become quite complex if it has to manage a large number of interactions between colleagues, potentially becoming a "god object."
  
### Use Cases

- **Chat Systems**: As demonstrated in the example, chat applications where users communicate via a central server.
- **Air Traffic Control Systems**: Where airplanes (colleagues) communicate through a central tower (mediator).
- **Form Validation**: Mediating interaction between various components of a form (e.g., fields, error messages) without them directly communicating with each other.

### Real-World Example

- **Air Traffic Control**: Planes don’t directly communicate with each other while in flight; instead, they interact with the control tower (mediator), which instructs them to take off, land, or change course.
- **GUI Components**: In graphical user interfaces, multiple components (like buttons, text fields, etc.) can interact with each other through a mediator, which helps reduce dependencies between components.

The **Mediator Design Pattern** promotes loose coupling by keeping the objects from having to refer to each other directly, improving modularity and flexibility in managing interactions between objects.
