The **Mediator Design Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that defines an object (the mediator) that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Instead of objects referring to each other directly, they interact through the mediator. This reduces the dependencies between communicating objects, allowing them to be loosely coupled and making the system easier to maintain and extend.

### Key Concepts

- **Mediator**: The central point of communication that controls and coordinates interactions between different objects (colleagues).
- **Colleague**: An object that communicates with other colleagues through the mediator.
- **ConcreteMediator**: A concrete implementation of the mediator that knows and maintains a reference to all colleagues.

### Example Scenario

Consider a chat room where multiple users (colleagues) can send messages to each other. Instead of each user directly sending a message to other users, the messages go through a central `ChatRoom` (the mediator). The `ChatRoom` knows all the users and handles the message routing.

### Implementation in Java

#### Step 1: Define the Mediator Interface

```java
interface ChatMediator {
    void sendMessage(String message, User user);
    void addUser(User user);
}
```

#### Step 2: Create the ConcreteMediator

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class ChatRoom implements ChatMediator {
    private List<User> users;

    public ChatRoom() {
        this.users = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    @Override
    public void addUser(User user) {
        this.users.add(user);
    }

    @Override
    public void sendMessage(String message, User user) {
        for (User u : this.users) {
            // Message should not be received by the user who sent it
            if (u != user) {
                u.receive(message);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Create the Colleague Class

```java
abstract class User {
    protected ChatMediator mediator;
    protected String name;

    public User(ChatMediator mediator, String name) {
        this.mediator = mediator;
        this.name = name;
    }

    public abstract void send(String message);
    public abstract void receive(String message);
}
```

#### Step 4: Create Concrete Colleague Classes

```java
class ChatUser extends User {

    public ChatUser(ChatMediator mediator, String name) {
        super(mediator, name);
    }

    @Override
    public void send(String message) {
        System.out.println(this.name + ": Sending Message = " + message);
        mediator.sendMessage(message, this);
    }

    @Override
    public void receive(String message) {
        System.out.println(this.name + ": Received Message = " + message);
    }
}
```

#### Step 5: Create the Client

```java
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ChatMediator chatRoom = new ChatRoom();

        User user1 = new ChatUser(chatRoom, "User1");
        User user2 = new ChatUser(chatRoom, "User2");
        User user3 = new ChatUser(chatRoom, "User3");
        User user4 = new ChatUser(chatRoom, "User4");

        chatRoom.addUser(user1);
        chatRoom.addUser(user2);
        chatRoom.addUser(user3);
        chatRoom.addUser(user4);

        user1.send("Hello, everyone!");
    }
}
```

### Output

```
User1: Sending Message = Hello, everyone!
User2: Received Message = Hello, everyone!
User3: Received Message = Hello, everyone!
User4: Received Message = Hello, everyone!
```

### Explanation

- **Mediator Interface (`ChatMediator`)**: Defines the methods that the mediator will use to facilitate communication between users.
- **Concrete Mediator (`ChatRoom`)**: Implements the mediator interface. It keeps track of all users and handles sending messages between them.
- **Colleague (`User`)**: Represents an abstract user in the chat room, containing a reference to the mediator.
- **Concrete Colleague (`ChatUser`)**: A concrete implementation of a user that sends and receives messages through the mediator.

### Benefits

- **Loose Coupling**: By centralizing communication in the mediator, colleagues don't need to know about each other, reducing dependencies.
- **Single Responsibility**: The mediator handles communication, while colleagues focus on their specific tasks.
- **Ease of Maintenance**: Modifying how communication happens is easier since itâ€™s centralized in the mediator.

### Drawbacks

- **Complexity**: The mediator can become complex if it handles many types of interactions between colleagues, potentially becoming a "God Object."

The Mediator pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple objects need to interact, but you want to avoid tight coupling between them, making your system more modular and easier to manage.
